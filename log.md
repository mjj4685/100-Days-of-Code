March 29. Monday

Project: Freecodecamp.org / Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)

Today's Progress: Started learning the fundamentals of Javascript. Attempted "is a prime number?" code kata ruby, failed. 
Attempted "Jaden Casing Strings" code kata ruby, and was successful!

Thoughts: Still a learning curve, but feeling more confident in applying the skills I've learned thus far.
